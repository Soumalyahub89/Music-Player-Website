# Music-Player-Website
This project is a web application that is fully responsive and is built using HTML, CSS,
Javascript. Javascript is preferred because it includes event based programming .It has 
built in events like ‘onClick’ and ‘onHower’ that waits for user interaction on a website 
before executing a specific segment of code. In this project we have also worked with 
Firebase ,thatis for the backend purpose , for storing the login id’s and the passwords.

## Project Overview
With the aim to develop an easy and efficient way to play music on a website. 
Music With US is an online music playing environment with some of the following features:-  Users can create an account by filling in their details by username and password.
 Users can play any song of their choice which they have added.
 Users can also search for the song of their choice and play it.
 Users can listen to their songs for as long they wish without any adds or without paying any 
money

## Requirement Specification
### HTML:
The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed 
to be displayed in a web browser. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of 
a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other 
objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means 
to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, 
lists, links, quotes and other items.

### CSS:
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World 
Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. 
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in 
the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by 
specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the 
structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the 
pages that share the file and its formatting.

### Javascript:
JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of 
the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on 
the client side for web page behaviour, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web 
browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to 
the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class 
functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming 
styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular 
expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, 
or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs 
for I/O.
